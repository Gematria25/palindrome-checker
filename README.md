# palindrome-checker
This project is a palindrome checker app created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Development certification.
It's a simple project, where there aren't many lines of code, therefore there are no lines of comment.
It's easy to use: once anything is typed in the <textarea> and the "Check" button is pressed, the program will state if the submitted string is a palindrome or not.
The program is insensible to case, symbols, and spaces. That means that only letters are read by the program, regardless of wether they are uppercase or lowercase, and separated by spaces or symbols.

P.S. The <img> file is a goodie for Pok√©mon fans like me ;)
